Grand Canyon Space Estimator
============================

How are we doing on space on our rafts?  Here are some little scripts to 
estimate how much space we'll have on the grand trip. Edit 
the YAML files to change assumptions, and then run `python gear.py` to generate
a report.

Here are the most recent results:
